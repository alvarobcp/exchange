# React + TailwindCSS + TypeScript

Currency Converter it is a little project to practice working with APIs, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.

The API used is [Fx Rates API](https://api.fxratesapi.com/)

I used [recharts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/recharts) to create a chart that displays exchange rate trends over the years.
